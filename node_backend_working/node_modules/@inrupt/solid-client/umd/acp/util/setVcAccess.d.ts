 * ```{note}

 *
 * Set the maximum access modes that are allowed for a VC holder for a given resource.
 * If the resource owner issued an Access Grant for the resource, the agent that
 * has been granted access will have at most the permissions set by this function.
 * The Access Grant may be more restrictive.
 *
 * Note that additional access may have been set if the ACR has been manipulated
 * not using this library, which is currently out of scope. In this case, the access
 * set by this function may not apply.
 *
 * @param resourceWithAcr The resource for which the access modes are being set for VC holders.
 * @param access The access modes to set. Setting a mode to `true` will enable it, to `false`
 * will disable it, and to `undefined` will leave it unchanged compared to what was previously
 * set.
 * @returns A copy of the resource and its attached ACR, updated to the new access modes.
 * @since 1.17.0
