 * - You can suggest a file name in the `slug` field.  However, the Solid
 *   Server may or may not use the suggested `slug` as the file name.

 * - *Recommended:* You can specify the [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type)
 *   of the file in the `contentType`.  If unspecified, the function uses the default type of
 *   `application/octet-stream`, indicating a binary data file.
 *
 * The function saves a file into an *existing* Container. If the
 * Container does not exist, either:
 * - Create the Container first using [[createContainerAt]], and then
 *   use the function, or
 * - Use [[overwriteFile]] to save the file. [[overwriteFile]] creates
 *   the Containers in the saved file path as needed.
 *
 * Users who only have `Append` but not `Write` access to a Container
 * can use [[saveFileInContainer]] to save new files to the Container.
 * That is, [[saveFileInContainer]] is useful in situations where users
 * can add new files to a Container but not change existing files in
 * the Container, such as users given access to send notifications to
 * another's Pod but not to view or delete existing notifications in that Pod.
 *
 * Users with `Write` access to the given folder/Container may prefer to
 * use [[overwriteFile]].
 *
 * @param folderUrl The URL of an existing folder where the new file is saved.
 * @param file The file to be written.
 * @param options Additional parameters for file creation (e.g. a slug).
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to the saved file, if available, or `null` if the current user does not have Read access to the newly-saved file. It rejects if saving fails.
