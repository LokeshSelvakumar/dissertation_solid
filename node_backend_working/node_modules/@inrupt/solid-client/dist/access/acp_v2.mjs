/**
 * Set access to a Resource for everybody.
 *
 * This function adds the relevant Access Control Policies and Matchers to a
 * Resource's Access Control Resource to define the given access for everybody
 * specifically. In other words, it can, for example, add Policies that
 * give everybody Read access to the Resource. However, if other
 * Policies specify that everybody is *denied* Read access *except* if they're
 * a particular Agent, then that will be left intact.
 * This means that, unless *only* this module's functions are used to manipulate
 * access to this Resource, the set access might not be equal to the effective
 * access for a particular Agent.
 *
 * There are a number of preconditions that have to be fulfilled for this
 * function to work:
 * - Access to the Resource is determined via an Access Control Resource.
 * - The Resource's Access Control Resource does not refer to (Policies or Matchers
 *   in) other Resources.
 * - The current user has access to the Resource's Access Control Resource.
 *
 * If those conditions do not hold, this function will return `null`.
 *
 * Additionally, take note that the given access will only be applied to the
 * given Resource; if that Resource is a Container, access will have to be set
 * for its contained Resources independently.
 *
 * @param resource Resource that was fetched together with its linked Access Control Resource.
 * @param acpData All Access Control Policies and Matchers that apply to a particular Resource.
 * @param access What access (read, append, write, controlRead, controlWrite) to set for everybody. `true` to allow, `false` to deny, and `undefined` to leave unchanged.
 * @returns The Resource with the updated Access Control Resource attached, if updated successfully, or `null` if not.
